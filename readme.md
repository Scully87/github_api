<h3> Created a simple page to show the use of Github user profiles through the 
developer API provided by Github themselves.</h3>

<h4>Within the page you can type in Github User names and the API will fetch and 
display the relevant data correlating to that specific user</h4>

<p>The page was made using JQuery over the html layout, css was used to style the it.
Sinatra gem was used as shown in the 'Gemfile' to locally host and then eventually
deploy the application to Heroku</p>
